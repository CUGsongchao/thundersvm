## Overview
The mission of ThunderSVM is to help users easily and efficiently apply SVMs to solve problems. ThunderSVM exploits GPUs and multi-core CPUs to achieve high efficiency. Key features of ThunderSVM are as follows.
* Support all functionalities of LibSVM such as one-class SVMs, SVC, SVR and probabilistic SVMs.
* Use same command line options as LibSVM.
* Support Python, R and Matlab interfaces.

**Why accelerate SVMs**: A [survey](https://www.kaggle.com/amberthomas/kaggle-2017-survey-results) conducted by Kaggle in 2017 shows that 26% of the data mining and machine learning practitioners are users of SVMs.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
* [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) 7.5 or above | cmake 2.8 or above | gcc 4.8 or above
### Download
```bash
git clone git@github.com:zeyiwen/thundersvm.git
```
### Build
```bash
cd thundersvm
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j
```
### Quick Start
```bash
./bin/thundersvm-train -c 100 -g 0.5 ../dataset/test_dataset.txt
./bin/thundersvm-predict ../dataset/test_dataset.txt test_dataset.txt.model test_dataset.predict
```
You will see `Accuracy = 0.98` after successful running.

## Advanced
## Working without GPUs
If you don't have GPUs, ThunderSVM can work with CPU only.
### Get Eigen Library
ThunderSVM uses [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) for matrix calculation. To use Eigen, just 
initialize the submodule. 
```bash
# in thundersvm root directory
git submodule init eigen && git submodule update
```
### Build without GPUs
```bash
# in thundersvm root directory
mkdir build && cd build && cmake -DUSE_CUDA=OFF -DUSE_EIGEN=ON .. && make -j
```
Now ThunderSVM will work solely on CPUs and does not rely on CUDA.
